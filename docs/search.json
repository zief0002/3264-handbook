    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the EPsy 3264 instructional team! This handbook contains information for people working with the course as TAs or instructors. It includes content related to expectations, instructional norms, and other useful tidbits that we have garnered across many semesters of teaching the course.\nThis handbook is a work in progress. While the handbook includes some of the information you will need to TA or teach the course, it probably doesn‚Äôt include all of it. I will add to this as I have time. The content is also being drawn from the collective memory and experiences of several cohorts of TAs and instructors‚Äîthus the knowledge contained herein will necessarily be imperfect.\nBecause of that it is important that you ask questions when things are unclear. This will also help me clarify the information in the handbook for future cohorts!"

This means that you should be spending about 10 hours per week (per position) on these responsibilities. It is important to note, however, that this ebbs and flows throughout the semester. Some weeks will be very sparse (\\(<10\\) hours), and others will be more demanding (\\(>10\\) hours). If you find yourself consistently putting in more than 10 hours, please let Andy or your instructor know so that we can figure out how to help you."

Most of their initial questions in the class are about using this software, so you will need to be familiar with using it early on. You can download a copy of TinkerPots 3 at:\n\nhttps://www.tinkerplots.com/get\n\nAfter you install it, and initially open it, you will need to fill in a registration number. Email Andy, and he will send you a registration number to use for the semester you are TAing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe best way to become familiar with how to use TinkerPlots is to work through the same course materials and assignments that the students work through."

(This would be good to work through in order to familiarize yourself not only with the content and TinkerPlots, but also to help anticipate where students might have questions in class.) The data sets are used in class and on the take-home exams that students complete. Lastly, the course readings/textbook are embedded in the website itself. This mainly consists of the out-of-class reading we ask students to complete."

    "title": "Responding to Student Questions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are several things that students may ask you about. Asking questions is part of the learning process, and if students are stuck on an individual exam or concerned about their course performance, we encourage them to reach out. However, since their work on the individual exams is one way we evaluate student performance, there is a delicate balance to how you as a TA can respond to their questions.\nBelow are a few examples of the types of questions or statements that students have had for the teaching team that are difficult for the teaching team to address.\n\nRequests for ‚ÄúPre-Grading‚Äù\nHere are examples of these types of requests:\n\n‚ÄúCould you look over my assignment and let me know if I did anything wrong?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIs my answer correct?‚Äù\n‚ÄúDid I write enough for this answer?‚Äù\n\nYou should not directly answer these requests. You can tell them that we do not do any pre-grading/looking at responses. If you think that the student is looking for assurance, you can respond by saying:\n\n‚ÄúIf you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! üòÑ‚Äù\n\nIf you think they have legitimate questions, try to redirect the student to ask something more specific. For example, you might say\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing! For example, do we need to include the plot for Question 2? Or, Do we need to define the p-value when using it as evidence for answering the research question?‚Äù\n\nIf the student is having trouble knowing what to include in their answer, remind them to look back at what the question is looking for.\n\n\nCompletely Open-Ended Requests\nHere are examples of these types of requests:\n\n‚ÄúI looked at the homework, but I do not know what to do. Can you give me a hint?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI did Step 1, what do I do next?‚Äù\n\nSimilar to requests for ‚Äúpre-grading‚Äù, you should not directly answer these requests. Instead, get the student to identify something specific to ask about. Maybe ask,\n\n‚ÄúWhat specifically are you unsure about?‚Äù\n\nGetting the student to ask a more specific question may both (1) help them better understand the assignment, and (2) actually help them answer their own question!\nSince the individual exams typically reflect the content covered in the in-class activities, the most helpful thing to do is to refer students back to the pertinent activity.\n\n\nOther Requests that are Difficult to Respond To\nHere are examples of these types of requests:\n\n‚ÄúI really need an ‚ÄòA‚Äô in this class.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so close to a higher grade. Can you look over my past assignments and find a way to give me some points back?‚Äù\n\nIf students make these types of statements, you can respond with empathy, but should remind them that the implication of these types of requests is for the teaching team to do something unethical, such as grade things differently for different students.\nInstead you can ask the student about ways to improve their future performance in the course. For example,\n\n‚ÄúI understand you really want to do well in this class. What else can you do in the future to better achieve that goal?‚Äù\n\nWhile we won‚Äôt change a score or grade for a student, we can help them to forescast their grade based on a number of scenarios, For example,\n\nHere are the scores you would need on the remaining coursework to earn an ‚ÄòA‚Äô in the course?\n\nThe exception to changing scores or grades is if the student thinks their grade or scores were computed incorrectly, we will double-check!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, you can respond to student questions about clarification or refer them to course resources, activities, etc. But, you should not help them complete their exams. You should also not re-grade or re-score anything. Instead, refer the student to the instructor who will make a decision about that."
