    "text": "Welcome to the EPsy 3264 instructional team! This handbook contains information for people working with the course as TAs or instructors. It includes content related to expectations, instructional norms, and other useful tidbits that we have garnered across many semesters of teaching the course.\nThis handbook is a work in progress. While the handbook includes some of the information you will need to TA or teach the course, it probably doesn’t include all of it. I will add to this as I have time. The content is also being drawn from the collective memory and experiences of several cohorts of TAs and instructors—thus the knowledge contained herein will necessarily be imperfect.\nBecause of that it is important that you ask questions when things are unclear. This will also help me clarify the information in the handbook for future cohorts!"

This means that you should be spending about 10 hours per week (per position) on these responsibilities. It is important to note, however, that this ebbs and flows throughout the semester. Some weeks will be very sparse (\\(<10\\) hours), and others will be more demanding (\\(>10\\) hours). If you find yourself consistently putting in more than 10 hours, please let Andy or your instructor know so that we can figure out how to help you."

You can download a copy of TinkerPots 3 at:\n\nhttps://www.tinkerplots.com/get\n\nAfter you install it, and initially open it, you will need to fill in a registration number. Email Andy, and he will send you a registration number to use for the semester you are TAing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe best way to become familiar with how to use TinkerPlots is to work through the same course materials and assignments that the students work through."

(This would be good to work through in order to familiarize yourself not only with the content and TinkerPlots, but also to help anticipate where students might have questions in class.) The data sets are used in class and on the take-home exams that students complete. Lastly, the course readings/textbook are embedded in the website itself. This mainly consists of the out-of-class reading we ask students to complete."

It is also important that if you add material to the drive, it is placed in the appropriate directory and follows the naming conventions used. This will ensure that the drive is kept tidy and organized."
