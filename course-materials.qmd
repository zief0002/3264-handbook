# Attending Class {.unnumbered}

One of the TA's responsibilities is to attend class each day. In class you are expected to take an active role in working with the students. This includes responding to student questions, and prompting groups that seem to be stuck or are not working in a collaborative manner---you will need to be walking around the classroom and paying attention to the students' discussions. Taking an active role in the class will also help you get to know the students, which will make it more likely that they will trust uyou enough to ask for help. 

To do this effectively, you will need to prepare for each class by being familiar with the course reading and the activity in the Lab Manual. (If this is your first time TAing the course, I highly recommend that you actually do the activity in advance of class.)
