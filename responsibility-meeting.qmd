# Meeting Regularly with the Instructor or Instructional Team {.unnumbered}

A final TA responsibility is to attend a weekly meeting with the instructor or instructional team. The time and location of this meeting will be determined at the beginning of the semester based on everyone's schedules. During this meeting, we discuss issues in the class, or in grading. We also talk through the grading of exams and quizzes, including the rubrics, to ensure that all the TAs are grading student work in a consistent manner.
