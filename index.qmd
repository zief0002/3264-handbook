# Wecome to the Team {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the EPsy 3264 instructional team! This handbook contains information for people working with the course as TAs or instructors. It includes content related to expectations, instructional norms, and other useful tidbits that we have garnered across many semesters of teaching the course. 

This handbook is a work in progress. While the handbook includes some of the information you will need to TA or teach the course, it probably doesn't include all of it. I will add to this as I have time. The content is also being drawn from the collective memory and experiences of several cohorts of TAs and instructors---thus the knowledge contained herein will necessarily be imperfect.

Because of that it is important that you ask questions when things are unclear. This will also help me clarify the information in the handbook for future cohorts!
